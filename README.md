# vodafoneMobileApi

I wanted to check how much mobile data I have left for this month but unfortunately, I was unable to access the  the mobile app because it is restricted on rooted phones. However, I found a workaround by modifying the app's APK file to bypass the root check. It was working for a few weeks but to my disappointment, I discovered that the app requires the latest version for each update before allowing access. As a solution, I thought of extracting the data from the web API. Unfortunately, the web API is protected by Google Captcha, so I decided to utilize the mobile API instead since it doesn't have Captcha protection. The app implemented SSL pinning, but I managed to bypass it by patching it and intercepting the traffic. Regrettably, the app crashes after retrieving the token. I attempted to decompile the Java code to interact with the API, but due to time constraints, I couldn't pursue this exploration further. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable project, and perhaps someone else or even myself will continue it in the future.
